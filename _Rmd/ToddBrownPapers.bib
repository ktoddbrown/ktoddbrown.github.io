abstract = {Abstract Salt marsh survival with sea-level rise (SLR) increasingly relies on soil organic carbon (SOC) accumulation and preservation. Using a novel combination of geochemical approaches, we characterized fine SOC (≤1 mm) supporting marsh elevation maintenance. Overlaying thermal reactivity, source (δ13C), and age (F14C) information demonstrates several processes contributing to soil development: marsh grass production, redeposition of eroded material, and microbial reworking. Redeposition of old carbon, likely from creekbanks, represented ∼9\%–17\% of shallow SOC (≤26 cm). Soils stored marsh grass-derived compounds with a range of reactivities that were reworked over centuries-to-millennia. Decomposition decreases SOC thermal reactivity throughout the soil column while the decades-long disturbance of ponding accelerated this shift in surface horizons. Empirically derived estimates of SOC turnover based on geochemical composition spanned a wide range (640–9,951 years) and have the potential to inform predictions of marsh ecosystem evolution.},

	Abstract = { Soil carbon has been measured for over a century in applications ranging from understanding biogeochemical processes in natural ecosystems to quantifying the productivity and health of managed systems. Consolidating diverse soil carbon datasets is increasingly important to maximize their value, particularly with growing anthropogenic and climate change pressures. In this progress report, we describe recent advances in soil carbon data led by the International Soil Carbon Network and other networks. We highlight priority areas of research requiring soil carbon data, including (a) quantifying boreal, arctic and wetland carbon stocks, (b) understanding the timescales of soil carbon persistence using radiocarbon and chronosequence studies, (c) synthesizing long-term and experimental data to inform carbon stock vulnerability to global change, (d) quantifying root influences on soil carbon and (e) identifying gaps in model--data integration. We also describe the landscape of soil datasets currently available, highlighting their strengths, weaknesses and synergies. Now more than ever, integrated soil data are needed to inform climate mitigation, land management and agricultural practices. This report will aid new data users in navigating various soil databases and encourage scientists to make their measurements publicly available and to join forces to find soil-related solutions. },

	Abstract = {Models assume that rainfall is the major moisture source driving decomposition. Non-rainfall moisture (NRM: high humidity, dew, and fog) can also induce standing litter decomposition, but there have been few measurements of NRM-mediated decomposition across sites and no efforts to extrapolate the contribution of NRM to larger scales to assess whether this mechanism can improve model predictions. Here, we show that NRM is an important, year-round source of moisture in grassland sites with contrasting moisture regimes using field measurements and modeling. We first characterized NRM frequency and measured NRM-mediated decomposition at two sites in the Namib Desert, Namibia (hyper-arid desert), and at one site in Iowa, USA (tallgrass prairie). NRM was frequent at all sites (85--99{\%} of hours that litter was likely to be wet were attributed to NRM) and tended to occur in cool, high-humidity periods for several hours or more at a time. NRM also resulted in CO2 release from microbes in standing litter at all sites when litter became sufficiently wet (>{\thinspace}5{\%} gravimetric moisture for fine litter and >{\thinspace}13{\%} for coarse), and significantly contributed to mass loss, particularly in the western Namib site that received almost no rain. When we modeled annual mass loss induced by NRM and rain and extrapolated our characterization of NRM decomposition to a final semiarid site (Sevilleta, New Mexico), we found that models driven by rainfall alone underestimated mass loss, while including NRM resulted in estimates within the range of observed mass loss. Together these findings suggest that NRM is an important missing component in quantitative and conceptual models of litter decomposition, but there is nuance involved in modeling NRM at larger scales.Specifically, temperature and physical features of the substrate emerge as factors that affect the microbial response to litter wetting under NRM in our sites, and require further study. Hourly humidity can provide an adequate proxy of NRM frequency, but site-specific calibration with litter wetness is needed to accurately attribute decomposition to periods when NRM wets litter. Greater recognition of NRM-driven decomposition and its interaction with other processes like photodegradation is needed, especially since fog, dew, and humidity are likely to shift under future climates.},

	Abstract = {Soils contain more than twice as much carbon as either the atmosphere or terrestrial vegetation. Soil respiration is one of the largest terrestrial fluxes in Earth's carbon-climate cycle. While soil warming frequently enhances rates of carbon efflux and respiration, the sensitivity of soil carbon stocks and soil respiration to temperature is an emerging area of research. This chapter reviews work on the importance of temperature sensitivity of soil carbon, soil respiration, soil microbes, enzymes, mycorrhiza, and plant roots. The current models on soil carbon and soil respiration are summarized in this chapter. We then recommend new research areas to further our understanding of soil carbon in response to warming across the globe.},

@article{Yan2018,
	Abstract = {Soil heterotrophic respiration (HR) is an important source of soil-to-atmosphere CO2 flux, but its response to changes in soil water content (θ) is poorly understood. Earth system models commonly use empirical moisture functions to describe the HR--θrelationship, introducing significant uncertainty in predicting CO2 flux from soils. Generalized, mechanistic models that address this uncertainty are thus urgently needed. Here we derive, test, and calibrate a novel moisture function, fm, that encapsulates primary physicochemical and biological processes controlling soil HR. We validated fm using simulation results and published experimental data, and established the quantitative relationships between parameters of fm and measurable soil properties, which enables fm to predict the HR--θrelationships for different soils across spatial scales. The fm function predicted comparable HR--θrelationships with laboratory and field measurements, and may reduce the uncertainty in predicting the response of soil organic carbon stocks to climate change compared with the empirical moisture functions currently used in Earth system models.},

@article{Luo2017,
	Abstract = {Terrestrial ecosystems have absorbed roughly 30 {\%} of anthropogenic CO2 emissions over the past decades, but it is unclear whether this carbon (C) sink will endure into the future. Despite extensive modeling and experimental and observational studies, what fundamentally determines transient dynamics of terrestrial C storage under global change is still not very clear. Here we develop a new framework for understanding transient dynamics of terrestrial C storage through mathematical analysis and numerical experiments. Our analysis indicates that the ultimate force driving ecosystem C storage change is the C storage capacity, which is jointly determined by ecosystem C input (e.g., net primary production, NPP) and residence time. Since both C input and residence time vary with time, the C storage capacity is time-dependent and acts as a moving attractor that actual C storage chases. The rate of change in C storage is proportional to the C storage potential, which is the difference between the current storage and the storage capacity. The C storage capacity represents instantaneous responses of the land C cycle to external forcing, whereas the C storage potential represents the internal capability of the land C cycle to influence the C change trajectory in the next time step. The influence happens through redistribution of net C pool changes in a network of pools with different residence times. Moreover, this and our other studies have demonstrated that one matrix equation can replicate simulations of most land C cycle models (i.e., physical emulators). As a result, simulation outputs of those models can be placed into a three-dimensional (3-D) parameter space to measure their differences. The latter can be decomposed into traceable components to track the origins of model uncertainty. In addition, the physical emulators make data assimilation computationally feasible so that both C flux- and pool-related datasets can be used to better constrain model predictions of land C sequestration. Overall, this new mathematical framework offers new approaches to understanding, evaluating, diagnosing, and improving land C cycle models.},

	Abstract = {A number of nonlinear microbial models of soil carbon decomposition have been developed. Some of them have been applied globally but have yet to be shown to realistically represent soil carbon dynamics in the field. A thorough analysis of their key differences is needed to inform future model developments. Here we compare two nonlinear microbial models of soil carbon decomposition: one based on reverse Michaelis--Menten kinetics (model A) and the other on regular Michaelis--Menten kinetics (model B). Using analytic approximations and numerical solutions, we find that the oscillatory responses of carbon pools to a small perturbation in their initial pool sizes dampen faster in model A than in model B. Soil warming always decreases carbon storage in model A, but in model B it predominantly decreases carbon storage in cool regions and increases carbon storage in warm regions. For both models, the CO2 efflux from soil carbon decomposition reaches a maximum value some time after increased carbon input (as in priming experiments). This maximum CO2 efflux (Fmax) decreases with an increase in soil temperature in both models. However, the sensitivity of Fmax to the increased amount of carbon input increases with soil temperature in model A but decreases monotonically with an increase in soil temperature in model B. These differences in the responses to soil warming and carbon input between the two nonlinear models can be used to discern which model is more realistic when compared to results from field or laboratory experiments. These insights will contribute to an improved understanding of the significance of soil microbial processes in soil carbon responses to future climate change.},

@article{Purcell2007,
	Abstract = {Whole-genome association studies (WGAS) bring new computational, as well as analytic, challenges to researchers. Many existing genetic-analysis tools are not designed to handle such large data sets in a convenient manner and do not necessarily exploit the new opportunities that whole-genome data bring. To address these issues, we developed PLINK, an open-source C/C++ WGAS tool set. With PLINK, large data sets comprising hundreds of thousands of markers genotyped for thousands of individuals can be rapidly manipulated and analyzed in their entirety. As well as providing tools to make the basic analytic steps computationally efficient, PLINK also supports some novel approaches to whole-genome data that take advantage of whole-genome coverage. We introduce PLINK and describe the five main domains of function: data management, summary statistics, population stratification, association analysis, and identity-by-descent estimation. In particular, we focus on the estimation and use of identity-by-state and identity-by-descent information in the context of population-based whole-genome studies. This information can be used to detect and correct for population stratification and to identify extended chromosomal segments that are shared identical by descent between very distantly related individuals. Analysis of the patterns of segmental sharing has the potential to map disease loci that contain multiple rare variants in a population-based linkage analysis.},

Computational terrestrial biogeochemistry (or the modeling of how dirt breaths) is a harrowing and exciting field requiring lighting fast reflexes and brute strength. This site documents my humble journey to the exciting world of scientific conferences, workshops, and working groups as well as epic struggles with computational quandaries and other quagmires of the field.

Thoughts and opinions on here are my own and do not reflect those of my employer, mentors, minions, pets, or other parties.

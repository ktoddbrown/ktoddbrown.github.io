I am a computational biogeochemist who uses mathematics and computers to understand how soil breathes.


I am an Assistant Professor at the University of FLorida in the Department of Environmental Engineering Sciences.

Soils are a major source of natural carbon dioxide (the greenhouse gas driving current climate change); soils are expected to emit more carbon dioxide as climate gets warmer, potentially creating a vicious feedback cycle.

By using data from multiple worldwide studies and simplifying or expanding the complexity of soil models to interoperate that data, I strive to give society a better understanding of this critical climate response.

I am passionate about data and open reproducible science.
As we continue to move towards data-rich research, informatics skills to archive, increase discoverability, and harmonize different data streams become more and more important.
Through my work with the International Soil Carbon Network, Iâ€™m working with collaborators across the global to address harmonization issues in soils.

I have been a Postdoctoral Fellow (2019) with Drs Jennifer Baltzer (Wilfred Laurier University) and Merriett Turetsky (Guelph University), a Distinguished Linus Pauling Postdoctoral Fellow at the Pacific Northwest National Lab, a United States Department of Energy laboratory in Richland, Washington (2015-2018), and a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Oklahoma (2014). I received my PhD (2013) from the University of California, Irvine from the Earth System Science Department. I also hold a Bachelor of Science (2004) from Harvey Mudd College in Claremont, California in Mathematics and I have worked as a software developer for bioinformatics tools at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts.

<h3>Earth system science</h3>

<p>
The intersection between climate and the environment is particularly relevant as the world begins to respond to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions.
Climate models provide the best insights into the effects of increases in greenhouse gas on regional climate patterns.
We work with the latest Earth system models to examine future climate implications on the environment.

<h3>Soil science</h3>

<p>
In particular, soil is a critical societal resource that responds to local environmental changes.
Soil organic carbon is expected to convert to atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> faster under warmer and, generally, wetter climates.
This has the potential to increase atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, which in turn exacerbates climate change, creating a vicious feedback.
Lower soil organic carbon levels will also negatively affect water retention and nutrient content of soils.
We specialize in soil carbon dynamics and the soil-climate interaction.

<h3>Informatics</h3>

<p>
Data is undergoing an explosion.
Organizing, preserving, and visualizing ever increasing data is an ongoing challenge.
We help manage and utilize community archives to help data live on.
</p>

<h3>Mathematics</h3>

<p>
Mathematical models capture scientific understanding in such a way that it is directly testable with data.
We can help translate science into mathematics using discrete and continuous mathematics to articulate your hypotheses and extend the implications over simulated space/time.

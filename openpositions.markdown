Our lab focuses on predicting soil biogeochemical dynamics under a changing climate. Research focuses on soil carbon dynamics from the pore to globe scales, spanning systems from coastal marshes to dry grasslands to boreal forests. We develop new models that explicitly represent the biological, chemical and physical processes governing soil biogeochemistry. We lead collaborative networks creating new data collections to address the growing need for diverse global datasets in soil models.

We are actively recruting PhD students and undergraduate reserachers!

**PhD student**

The Todd-Brown Lab at the University of Florida would like to invite you to apply for one of two PhD students assistantships beginning in Spring or Fall of 2020. Graduate students will have a large degree of freedom to choose their research topic, students with targeted research interests are particularly encouraged to apply. Research in this lab is compute driven. However there are opportunities to collaborate with field and bench scientists, and students should expect to interact regularly with non-computational researchers.

The ideal applicate should either have a background in biogeochemistry with a strong interest in modeling and informatics OR a background in mathematics/computer science with a strong interest in soils. Applicants must have excellent written and oral communication skills. Applicants from underrepresented groups are particularly encouraged to apply.

Assistantships include stipend, tuition, and benefits. Interested applicants should email Dr Todd-Brown (kathe.toddbrown [[at]] essie [[dot]] ufl [[dot]] edu) a copy of their CV and a brief cover letter outlining their interests and suitability for the assistantship. 

Most foreign national applications are not eligable for this specific assistantship but are encougaged to inquire regardless and other lines of funding can be investigaged.

**Undergraduate researcher**

The Todd-Brown Lab is looking for undergraduate students interested in doing research! There are several research projects underway which have opportunities for undergraduate researchers interested in data science and modeling soil carbon dynamics. Some current projects include working with researchers to develop graphical user interfaces for soil carbon models, contributing to one of the largest soil carbon data collections in the world, and collaboratively developing new soil carbon models.

The ideal applicate should be interested in soils and have an understanding of the fundamentals of programing (ie able to load a data set and create a graph). Applicants must have excellent written and oral communication skills. Applicants from underrepresented groups are particularly encouraged to apply.

Interested applicants should email Dr Todd-Brown (kathe.toddbrown [[at]] essie [[dot]] ufl [[dot]] edu) a copy of their CV and a brief cover letter outlining their interests and suitability.

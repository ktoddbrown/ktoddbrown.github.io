Our lab focuses on predicting soil biogeochemical dynamics under a changing climate. Research focuses on soil carbon dynamics from the pore to globe scales, spanning systems from coastal marshes to dry grasslands to boreal forests. We develop new models that explicitly represent the biological, chemical and physical processes governing soil biogeochemistry. We lead collaborative networks creating new data collections to address the growing need for diverse global datasets in soil models.

We are actively recruiting PhD students!

**PhD student**

The Todd-Brown Lab at the University of Florida would like to invite you to apply for one of two PhD students assistantships beginning in Spring or Fall of 2020. Graduate students will have a large degree of freedom to choose their research topic, students with targeted research interests are particularly encouraged to apply. Research in this lab is compute driven. However there are opportunities to collaborate with field and bench scientists, and students should expect to interact regularly with non-computational researchers.

The ideal applicate should either have a background in biogeochemistry with a strong interest in modeling and informatics OR a background in mathematics/computer science with a strong interest in soils. Applicants must have excellent written and oral communication skills. Applicants from underrepresented groups are particularly encouraged to apply.

Assistantships include stipend, tuition, and benefits. Interested applicants should email Dr Todd-Brown (kathe.toddbrown [[at]] essie [[dot]] ufl [[dot]] edu) a copy of their CV and a brief cover letter outlining their interests and suitability for the assistantship.

Most (but not all) foreign national applications are not eligible for this specific assistantship but are encouraged to inquire regardless and other lines of funding can be investigated.


**Undergraduate researcher (UF students)**

The Todd-Brown Lab is looking for undergraduate researchers for the Summer of 2020!

We are looking for students to work with a project with two main goals: estimate the land carbons stocks in a set of proposed protected areas in northern Canada and develop a model to simulate how changes in wildfire dynamics will affect the carbon stocks in this area.

Students will work on one of three topics:

  1)	Uncertainty analysis of land classification-based maps of soil and vegetation carbon stocks in protected areas and evaluation of within-site variance in carbon stocks as a contributor to uncertainty
  2)	Development of a user interface for the Growth-Burn-Decay (GBD) model and refinement of parameterization including sensitivity analysis
  3)	Scenario development in the GBD model to evaluate the impact of ecosystem shifts in response to fire in the land carbon dynamics

Students will be working on teams and should be comfortable using R/Rmarkdown to conduct one or more of the following tasks: ingest data, create figures, work with ordinary differential equations using numerical solvers, document software, and create scientific reports. Students with a background and interest in land biogeochemistry are particularly encouraged to apply.

 Interested applicants should email Dr Todd-Brown (kathe.toddbrown [[at]] essie [[dot]] ufl [[dot]] edu) a copy of their CV and a brief cover letter outlining their interests and suitability for the assistantship.

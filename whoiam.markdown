title: Who I Am

I am a computational biogeochemist who uses mathematics and computers to understand how soil breaths.
Soils are a major source of natural carbon dioxide (the greenhouse gas driving current climate change); soils are expected to emit more carbon dioxide as climate gets warmer, potentially creating a vicious feedback cycle.
By using data from multiple world-wide studies and simplifying or expanding the complexity of soil models to interoperate that data, I strive to give society a better understanding of this critical climate response.

I am passionate about data and open reproducible science.
As we continue to move towards data-rich research, informatics skills to archive, increase discoverability, and harmonize different data streams becomes more and more important.
Through my work with the International Soil Carbon Network, Iâ€™m working with collaborators across the global to address harmonization issues in soils.

I am a Distinguished Linus Pauling Postdoctoral Fellow at the Pacific Northwest National Lab, a United States Department of Energy laboratory in Richland, Washington (2015-2018). I have been a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Oklahoma (2014). I received my PhD (2013) from the University of California, Irvine from the Earth System Science Department. I also hold a Bachelor of Science (2004) from Harvey Mudd College in Claremont, California in Mathematics and I have worked as a software developer for bioinformatics tools at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts.
